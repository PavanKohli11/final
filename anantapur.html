<h1>penukonda fort</h1>
<p>At a distance of 3 km from Penukonda Railway Station, 79 km from Anantapur, 436 km from Hyderabad, 550 km from Vijayawada and 142 km Bangalore, Penukonda Fort is a medieval fort situated at Penukonda in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.

Penukonda was once served as the 2nd capital of Vijayanagar Kingdom after the fall of Hampi and was earlier called as Ghanagiri or Ghanadri. According to the inscriptions, the Penukonda state was gifted by the King Bukka-I to his son Virupanna. This fort was built at the time of Virupanna. This fort was one of the best defenses of the Vijayanagara kingdom. With the decline of Vijayanagara kingdom, the Sultan of Golconda captured this fort. Later Mysore Kingdom captured this fort briefly until British overtook after the fall of Tipu Sultan.</p>

<h1>gooty fort</h1>
<p>Gooty Fort', also known as 'Gutti Fort' is considered to be one of the earliest surviving forts of Andhra Pradesh. Gooty Fort was always on our list of must visit places, but never happened until last year. It was during our day one of road trip to Madhya Pradesh, while driving from Bangalore towards Hyderabad that we decided to stop by Gooty Fort in order to break the monotony of driving. It was afternoon and the weather was quite hot to explore this fort, but we decided to go ahead with the ascent. This hill fort is also known as Ravadurga and is spread across 3 hills located to the North of the current village of Gooty.">

<h1> ahobilam temple</h1>
<p>Ahobilam Temple is a very famous place of worship dedicated to the Narasimha Avatar of Lord Vishnu. Narasimha was the unique incarnation that Vishnu took to put an end to the ruthless demon Hiranyakashipu and, thus, save Hiranya's son and Vishnu devotee Prahlada and the people, from the atrocities of the Rakshasa. As the name suggests, Nara Simha was the terrific form with a human body and a lion face and features, which the Lord took to circumvent the incredible boons that the demon obtained and overpower him. This temple is also known as Singavel Kundram, where 'Singam' means lion in Tamil, and 'Kundram' is a mountain. Ahobilam is a cluster of temples located in the mountain ranges of the Eastern Ghats in the Ahobilam village, Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. There are 9 temples for the various forms of Narasimha, spread within a circle of about 5 km, while there is also a temple for him as Prahlada Varada, at the foothills. Thus the temples are spread between the upper and lower Ahobilams. The Azhwar saints have sung the glory of this Lord in many of their hymns, and hence, this shrine is also regarded as a Divya Desam, a very sacred abode of Lord Vishnu.</p>
